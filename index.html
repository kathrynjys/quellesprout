            <h2> Hello and Introduction </h2>
        
            <p> <strong>Welcome to my brand new, clean, fresh, yet to be properly decorated and decoupaged, art page!</strong> <br/> I have been wanting to start an art page for years now, and honestly just never got around to it. I didn’t think I’d do a grand job with one anyway, so the motivation was extremely low. But lately I’ve just really been feeling ready to share, beyond ready to have a voice, and ready to properly document my experiences and feelings about them. And what better way to embrace those feelings than to finally start the art page I've always wanted!</p>

        <img src="/Users/kathrynshannon/Desktop/Webpage/images webpage/quelle family .jpg" alt="quelle family portrait by Kathleen Brien"> 
        
        <p> My name is Raquelle Ivory Lovelace, and I am a 22 year old from Orlando, Florida, currently residing in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. I am the mom to a bold little 15 (almost 16) month old, Luna June Lovelace, and future wife to my favorite dude, who also happens to be the father of my small human, Dorian Basner. I am an illustrator, stay-at-home mom, and a big enthusiast of plants, women, art history, cute things, nerd things, and social justice things. </p>
        
        <p> I am excited to meet you, to be starting this journey of art and words, and beyond excited to share my life and experiences with you! I hope you enjoy the stories and lessons learned that are to come here, and feel free to also enjoy my life via my Instagrams.</p>
